                <h5>Our Founder</h5>
                <p>Gordon Ramsay founded Hell's University in 1998, in conjunction with his first restaurant, however it
                    was originally named Gordon Ramsay University.<br><br>Frustrated with how difficult it was to get a
                    good education in the culinary industry, as well as finding great mentors, Gordon decided to take it
                    into his own hands and create a platform for passionate people to make it big.<br><br>"Put your head
                    down and work hard. Never wait for things to happen, make them happen for yourself through hard
                    graft and not giving up.‚Äù</p>

                <h3><br>Education within the culinary arts has been neglected for centuries.</h3>
                <p><br><br>Here at Hell's University, we want to open the doors for young and passionate chefs to a
                    world of opportunity and advancement.<br>

                    Our team at Hell's University, including numerous
                    Michelin star chefs, strive to perfect all students abilities.

                    <br><br>All top students of each class will be invited to join
                    Hell's Kitchen, where if they win, they will receive
                    $250,000 and the opportunity to be the head
                    chef at one of Ramsay's restaurants.

                    <br><br>We want to challenge the status quo of
                    what it means to educate, and we
                    want to make it our mission to ensure
                    students can live up to their potential
                    and fight for what they believe in.

                    <br><br>"Through food, we are united."
